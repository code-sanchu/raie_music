					Scots-born, London-based, Raie is one of life's trip-me-up revelations. A purveyor of
					pin-me-to-the wall, beautiful, life-enhancing soul music. A sweet, certain surpriseâ€¦ Raie
					has paid her dues playing live for many years - slipping through the net commercially,
					making astounding music. Chances are, Raie is playing somewhere in London right now and a
					select few are having their ears flipped over by her incredible voice...

					Nearly fifty years in to a professional career of recording and performing as a backing
					singer with a variety of 'name' artists, Scottish songstress Raie has finally stepped
					forward with a solo album. And what a beautifully assured debut it is. Raie's first love
					is country music, and the opening 'Healin' Train' is a glorious blast of jangly electric
					guitar Americana. But whilst there are shades of Nashville throughout, the infusion of
					other soulful, bluesy and even gospel-laced influences delivers a diverse concoction which
					has its own original distinctiveness...
