			'Hey girl - you lookin worried<br /> Walkin home on a rainy night<br /> You in no hurry<br /> Like something on your mind<br /> Maybe you lost your man to sweet<br /> Or struggling to make ends meet<br /> Tryin’ to make a house a home<br /> On nothing and dry bone<br /><br /> Stars that’s fallin’ <br /> Too far to catch <br /> Our pockets are empty<br /> But not our hearts<br /> Wax and wane the moon<br /> That day is comin’ soon<br /> Its only a lifetime <br /> Of fallin’ stars<br /> Before we’re goin’ home<br /><br /> Hey man – your load is heavy<br /> Walkin’ home under moonlight <br /> You’re pieced together<br /> With tape and tied on tight<br /> How you reach there I don’t know<br /> Your broken body moves you so slow<br /> Jangled outa space and time <br /> A discord in your rhyme<br /><br /> Seems like the evening lasts<br /> Full of day time woe<br /> It holds the memories fast<br /> Until the light has passed<br /> And we can feel the glow of …<br /> Stars …..
