		aboutHref: null,
		testimony:
			"I have worked with Rachel for many years in different sectors, she is always my first-choice voice specialist and singing workshop leader to invite into any project because she is a pro running workshops, bringing sunshine and joy into a session, adapting sessions to people’s needs and just being professional and thoroughly prepared. She usually has a loyal following of participants who come back again and again for her singing sessions because she is an engaging and sensitive and talented all-round human and really knows her stuff. What she can help a group of non-singers achieve in 90-minutes is amazing, harmonies, a wellbeing boost and so much more! A safe pair of hands and an experienced practitioner for community projects or more work-based wellbeing environments."

		testimony:
			"Rachel is the best vocal coach I've come across! To me she is a sorceress, as the vocal exercises and suggestions she makes improve my voice, and the delivery of my songs, so dramatically it feels like magic. She is also a very soothing presence just before a big show and has really made me feel more at ease and confident about performing. I really love being coached by Rachel and recommend her to every vocalist I meet."

		aboutHref: 'https://www.ayoungertheatre.com/author/steve-medlin/',
		testimony:
			"Rachel is my go-to musical director, her ability to draw out the skills base of professional and non- professional singers across a wide range of genres is a gift to any production. If its large choral pieces or the development of a singer in a 1:1 setting its Rachel's immense base of knowledge that I want in the room."

		testimony:
			"Rachel is the best singing teacher I've ever had! I used to have problems with my voice getting tired easily, but since working with her and practicing her exercises my voice has gained a lot of strength and stamina to survive on tour. 11/10 would recommend."

		name: 'Rotem Haguel',
		title: 'Producer',
		aboutHref: 'https://www.garnishmusicproduction.com/courses/rotem-haguel/',
		testimony:
			'As a producer, I often work with singer-songwriters at the start of their career. When it comes to vocal recording, since I am not a singer myself, I often do not have the language to convey feedback on vocal takes. Having worked with Rachel on a number of occasions now, I have found both her presence and approach to be very useful in a studio scenario. This is not only because she manages to communicate my ideas to the singer so brilliantly, but also because she helps singers look at songs from a holistic perspective: coming up with strategies for digging deep into their underlying emotions, always with a calm and playful approach. Absolutely love working with her. :-)'

		title: 'Black British Theatre Awards winning Actress for FOLK by Nell Leyshon',
		aboutHref: 'https://twitter.com/theBBTAs/status/1583126716943585282',
		testimony:
			"Before I began studying with Rachel, I really didn't enjoy singing in public at all. The thought of it made me incredibly nervous and uncomfortable. Rachel has somehow, miraculously reignited my joy for singing. She has such a welcoming, encouraging and loving approach to teaching- there is never any judgement or mention of getting things 'right'. The lessons are very much a collaboration which I love and I am always amazed at her knowledge and patience in explaining or demonstrating any questions that I have. Rachel has such a magic ability to pull song out of you, she is able to recognise what you need and guide you to a place where suddenly you find YOUR voice with such ease and most importantly joy."

		testimony:
			'The first time I went to Rachel I only had about two 1 hour sessions and revolutionized my Singing with knowledge i used all the time and still do. Some years later I felt like i had lost much of my singing ability and was a bit nervous to even sing in front of a coach, but Rachel is so chilled and accommodating to your level and confidence, she makes it very easy to relax into the session. I fully recommend Rachel as a vocal coach.'
