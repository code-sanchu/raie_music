	Raie has performed in a host of top venues in London including Hammersmith Apollo, The Forge Camden,
	Camden Round House, The Albany Theatre in Deptford as well as more recently at Purcell Room on London’s
	Southbank.<br /><br />
	Raie’s debut as a singer songwriter was a tour of London’s South East with guitarist Dan Cochrane;
	she went on to collaborate with a line up of superb musicians including Peter J Pinto (Modern Romance)
	and Manley O’Connor (Yolanda Brown) … to continue on the London Country Blues circuit.<br /><br />
	Music has been in Raie’s life from a young age when she sang for audiences in various contests in Scotland
	– winning accolades as a young ‘protest singer’.<br /><br />
	Raie came to her singer songwriter career later in life but has enjoyed a successful career working
	with upcoming artistes in her role as vocal tutor and coach … you can read about her work in the
	<Link href="/voice-coaching" target="_self">voice coaching section</Link>.<br /><br />
	Raie prefers to keep details of her family life relatively private as she is now a grandmother to two
	beautiful children … and the proud mother of a wonderful son.
