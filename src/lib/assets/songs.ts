			"Ruby is that you<br/>Runnin' cross my skyline<br/>Where the freight trains cry<br/>‘Gainst the Alabama rain<br/>I'm callin' from your window<br/>Words fallin' on the wind<br/>Rusty nail torn curtains blowin'<br/>It's a dirty shame<br/><br/> Ruby don't run<br/>Wear out what's left ‘a your shoes<br/>Don't burn out<br/>Everything might just<br/>Turn out<br/>I know you're frettin'<br/>‘Bout what I can see<br/>But I believe your soul<br/>Needs to be free<br/>‘Cos Ruby<br/>You dreamed me<br/><br/> Ruby you know<br/>Why I came here<br/>With my platinum hair<br/>An' my city ways<br/>You took me walkin'<br/>Real talkin' bout your first kiss<br/>‘Gainst the rusty old turbines<br/>Lyin' in decay<br/><br/> Ruby don't fear<br/>What's inside of you<br/>Try'n' stay strong<br/>Even if you know<br/>You done wrong<br/>I know you're hidin'<br/>From your history<br/>But I believe your soul<br/>Is longin' to be free<br/>‘Cos Ruby<br/>You dreamed me<br/><br/> You got so much goin' on<br/>But nothin' to lose<br/>From the Whitehouse lawn<br/>To the soup kitchen line<br/>A whole nation wanna' hear<br/>The truth you choose<br/>An' if you come right<br/>You might mend that ache<br/>If you come contrite<br/>I could open my eyes<br/>And live this dream<br/>When I awake<br/><br/><b>Newscaster</b><br/>Under a typical Charlottsville tin coloured sky, violent clashes between white nationalists and Black Lives Matter activists put an end to a noon rally that hadn't even begun. <br/>The activists are defending the right to remove a confederate statue that they believe represents white supremacy; in a time when unarmed black youth are still being shot down in cold blood between here and the county line<br/><br/><br/>Ruby you testified<br/>In your brand new clothes<br/>On the courthouse steps<br/>The camera caught you smilin'<br/>But runnin ‘cross your eyes	<br/> I see your first boy	<br/> The one who kissed you ‘gainst the turbines<br/>With the dark brown skin <br/><br/> Ruby you tangled with truth<br/>Till your life let you go		<br/>An now there's too many<br/>Firearms in the hands of fives<br/>An' saggin' in death row	<br/> But you can help us fight<br/>‘Gainst the powers that be<br/>An' I believe you want to<br/>Cos Ruby you dreamed me<br/>Yeah Ruby Ruby Ruby<br/>You dreamed me<br/>Ruby Ruby Ruby<br/>You dreamed me <br/>",
