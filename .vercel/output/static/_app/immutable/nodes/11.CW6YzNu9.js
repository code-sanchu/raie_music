When it comes to vocal recording, since I am not a singer myself, I often do not have the language to convey feedback on vocal takes. Having worked with Rachel on a number of occasions now, I have found both her presence and approach to be very useful in a studio scenario. This is not only because she manages to communicate my ideas to the singer so brilliantly, but also because she helps singers look at songs from a holistic perspective: coming up with strategies for digging deep into their underlying emotions, always with a calm and playful approach. Absolutely love working with her. :-)"},{name:"Sasha Frost",title:"Black British Theatre Awards winning Actress for FOLK by Nell Leyshon",aboutHref:"https://twitter.com/theBBTAs/status/1583126716943585282",testimony:"Before I began studying with Rachel, I really didn't enjoy singing in public at all.

She has such a welcoming, encouraging and loving approach to teaching- there is never any judgement or mention of getting things 'right'. The lessons are very much a collaboration which I love and I am always amazed at her knowledge and patience in explaining or demonstrating any questions that I have. Rachel has such a magic ability to pull song out of you, she is able to recognise what you need and guide you to a place where suddenly you find YOUR voice with such ease and most importantly joy."},{name:"Jesse James McFarlane",title:"The WiseBloods",aboutHref:"https://www.thewisebloods.com/",testimony:"The first time I went to Rachel I only had about two 1 hour sessions and revolutionized my Singing with knowledge i used all the time and still do.
